Gowri Akash ,Dashing Hawks ,03-Apr,akashgowri.jogi@gmail.com,7569831272,Mallareddy College of Engineering ,2,Hyderabad,Telengana,How much the Crab pulsar has slowed down since launch of AstroSat? Finding rate of spin down rate of Crab pulsar with AstroSat LAXPC and CZTI observations,"I have query that X ray detection through astrosat, it would take a long gap to deduct the  
X ray emission from the crab pulsar , even the astrosat is revolving around the earth from north pole to south pole . So I have a small doubt whether we need to include the time analysis with the previous data to interrupt with the model ?",,,,,,,,,"Dont worry about the datasets, it will be shared after the ideation round, currently you have to just pitch an idea. However, data sets are available from the link given in the problem description, which may be used for understanding the type of data to pitch a solution.",,,,

Finding rate of spin down rate of Crab pulsar with AstroSat LAXPC and CZTI observations,Can you please tell which dataset to use for the first round? In the group it was said to use Dummy dataset from Kaggle but it would be helpful if mentioned exactly which Kaggle dataset to be used (name needed).,How much the Crab pulsar has slowed down since launch of AstroSat? Finding rate of spin down rate of Crab pulsar with AstroSat LAXPC and CZTI observations,Do we need to use HEASoft or LAXPCsoft only ? ,,,,,,,"Dont worry about the datasets, it will be shared after the ideation round, currently you have to just pitch an idea.
